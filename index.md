Honeypot deployment and management automation

## Simple deployments for your platform

CHN aims to make deployments honeypots and honeypot management tools easy and flexible. The default deployment method uses Docker Compose and Docker to deploy with a few simple commands.  Want to jump right in an get started?  Deploy a honeypot management server and sample honeypot in minutes with the [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md).

With flexibility in mind, though, all parts of the project can be deployed separately, with or without containers, on CentOS or Ubuntu hosts.  Check the [advanced configuration documentation](config.md), [installing and running without Docker](nondocker.md), or [deploying to cloud providers](cloud.md).

## Contributing

Contributions to the CommunityHoneyNetwork project are welcome!  Afterall, it's not much of a community without your help.  Documentation always needs help, individual projects each have their own issues or bugs that need to be addressed, and test coverage can always be improved.

To contribute, submit a pull request to one of the [CommunityhoneyNetwork projects](https://github.com/CommunityHoneyNetwork) you'd like to work with. 

In order to merge the pull request, it'll have to take the following steps:

* Create the PR
* Pass the automated Travis CI builds
* Get an `LGTM` (looks good to me) from a reviewer
* Get approval from an owner
