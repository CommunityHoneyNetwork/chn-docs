Honeypot deployment and management automation

## Simple deployments for your platform

CHN aims to make deployments honeypots and honeypot management tools easy and flexible. The default deployment method uses Docker Compose and Docker to deploy with a few simple commands.  Want to jump right in an get started?  Deploy a honeypot management server and sample honeypot in minutes with the [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md).

With flexibility in mind, though, all parts of the project can be deployed separately, with or without containers, on CentOS or Ubuntu hosts.

Or, if you prefer, check out more [Advanced Deployment Options](advanced.md), including running on multiple hosts, installing and running without Docker, and running in Amazon Webservices.
